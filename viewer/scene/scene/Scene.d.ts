/**
 * @desc Contains the components that comprise a 3D scene.
 *
 * * A {@link Viewer} has a single Scene, which it provides in {@link Viewer#scene}.
 * * Plugins like {@link AxisGizmoPlugin} also have their own private Scenes.
 * * Each Scene has a corresponding {@link MetaScene}, which the Viewer provides in {@link Viewer#metaScene}.
 *
 * ## Getting a Viewer's Scene
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var scene = viewer.scene;
 * ````
 *
 * ## Creating and accessing Scene components
 *
 * As a brief introduction to creating Scene components, we'll create a {@link Mesh} that has a
 * {@link buildTorusGeometry} and a {@link PhongMaterial}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var teapotMesh = new Mesh(scene, {
 *     id: "myMesh",                               // <<---------- ID automatically generated if not provided
 *     geometry: new TorusGeometry(scene),
 *     material: new PhongMaterial(scene, {
 *         id: "myMaterial",
 *         diffuse: [0.2, 0.2, 1.0]
 *     })
 * });
 *
 * teapotMesh.scene.camera.eye = [45, 45, 45];
 * ````
 *
 * Find components by ID in their Scene's {@link Scene#components} map:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var teapotMesh = scene.components["myMesh"];
 * teapotMesh.visible = false;
 *
 * var teapotMaterial = scene.components["myMaterial"];
 * teapotMaterial.diffuse = [1,0,0]; // Change to red
 * ````
 *
 * A Scene also has a map of component instances for each {@link Component} subtype:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var meshes = scene.types["Mesh"];
 * var teapotMesh = meshes["myMesh"];
 * teapotMesh.xrayed = true;
 *
 * var phongMaterials = scene.types["PhongMaterial"];
 * var teapotMaterial = phongMaterials["myMaterial"];
 * teapotMaterial.diffuse = [0,1,0]; // Change to green
 * ````
 *
 * See {@link Node}, {@link Node} and {@link Model} for how to create and access more sophisticated content.
 *
 * ## Controlling the camera
 *
 * Use the Scene's {@link Camera} to control the current viewpoint and projection:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var camera = myScene.camera;
 *
 * camera.eye = [-10,0,0];
 * camera.look = [-10,0,0];
 * camera.up = [0,1,0];
 *
 * camera.projection = "perspective";
 * camera.perspective.fov = 45;
 * //...
 * ````
 *
 * ## Managing the canvas
 *
 * The Scene's {@link Canvas} component provides various conveniences relevant to the WebGL canvas, such
 * as firing resize events etc:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var canvas = scene.canvas;
 *
 * canvas.on("boundary", function(boundary) {
 *     //...
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## Picking
 *
 * Use {@link Scene#pick} to pick and raycast entites.
 *
 * For example, to pick a point on the surface of the closest entity at the given canvas coordinates:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var pickResult = scene.pick({
 *      pickSurface: true,
 *      canvasPos: [23, 131]
 * });
 *
 * if (pickResult) { // Picked an entity
 *
 *     var entity = pickResult.entity;
 *
 *     var primitive = pickResult.primitive; // Type of primitive that was picked, usually "triangles"
 *     var primIndex = pickResult.primIndex; // Position of triangle's first index in the picked Mesh's Geometry's indices array
 *     var indices = pickResult.indices; // UInt32Array containing the triangle's vertex indices
 *     var localPos = pickResult.localPos; // Float64Array containing the picked Local-space position on the triangle
 *     var worldPos = pickResult.worldPos; // Float64Array containing the picked World-space position on the triangle
 *     var viewPos = pickResult.viewPos; // Float64Array containing the picked View-space position on the triangle
 *     var bary = pickResult.bary; // Float64Array containing the picked barycentric position within the triangle
 *     var normal = pickResult.normal; // Float64Array containing the interpolated normal vector at the picked position on the triangle
 *     var uv = pickResult.uv; // Float64Array containing the interpolated UV coordinates at the picked position on the triangle
 * }
 * ````
 *
 * ## Pick masking
 *
 * We can use {@link Scene#pick}'s ````includeEntities```` and ````excludeEntities````  options to mask which {@link Mesh}es we attempt to pick.
 *
 * This is useful for picking through things, to pick only the Entities of interest.
 *
 * To pick only Entities ````"gearbox#77.0"```` and ````"gearbox#79.0"````, picking through any other Entities that are
 * in the way, as if they weren't there:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var pickResult = scene.pick({
 *      canvasPos: [23, 131],
 *      includeEntities: ["gearbox#77.0", "gearbox#79.0"]
 * });
 *
 * if (pickResult) {
 *       // Entity will always be either "gearbox#77.0" or "gearbox#79.0"
 *       var entity = pickResult.entity;
 * }
 * ````
 *
 * To pick any pickable Entity, except for ````"gearbox#77.0"```` and ````"gearbox#79.0"````, picking through those
 * Entities if they happen to be in the way:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var pickResult = scene.pick({
 *      canvasPos: [23, 131],
 *      excludeEntities: ["gearbox#77.0", "gearbox#79.0"]
 * });
 *
 * if (pickResult) {
 *       // Entity will never be "gearbox#77.0" or "gearbox#79.0"
 *       var entity = pickResult.entity;
 * }
 * ````
 *
 * See {@link Scene#pick} for more info on picking.
 *
 * ## Querying and tracking boundaries
 *
 * Getting a Scene's World-space axis-aligned boundary (AABB):
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var aabb = scene.aabb; // [xmin, ymin, zmin, xmax, ymax, zmax]
 * ````
 *
 * Subscribing to updates to the AABB, which occur whenever {@link Entity}s are transformed, their
 * {@link ReadableGeometry}s have been updated, or the {@link Camera} has moved:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * scene.on("boundary", function() {
 *      var aabb = scene.aabb;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * Getting the AABB of the {@link Entity}s with the given IDs:
 *
 * ````JavaScript
 * scene.getAABB(); // Gets collective boundary of all Entities in the scene
 * scene.getAABB("saw"); // Gets boundary of an Object
 * scene.getAABB(["saw", "gearbox"]); // Gets collective boundary of two Objects
 * ````
 *
 * See {@link Scene#getAABB} and {@link Entity} for more info on querying and tracking boundaries.
 *
 * ## Managing the viewport
 *
 * The Scene's {@link Viewport} component manages the WebGL viewport:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var viewport = scene.viewport
 * viewport.boundary = [0, 0, 500, 400];;
 * ````
 *
 * ## Controlling rendering
 *
 * You can configure a Scene to perform multiple "passes" (renders) per frame. This is useful when we want to render the
 * scene to multiple viewports, such as for stereo effects.
 *
 * In the example, below, we'll configure the Scene to render twice on each frame, each time to different viewport. We'll do this
 * with a callback that intercepts the Scene before each render and sets its {@link Viewport} to a
 * different portion of the canvas. By default, the Scene will clear the canvas only before the first render, allowing the
 * two views to be shown on the canvas at the same time.
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * var viewport = scene.viewport;
 *
 * // Configure Scene to render twice for each frame
 * scene.passes = 2; // Default is 1
 * scene.clearEachPass = false; // Default is false
 *
 * // Render to a separate viewport on each render
 *
 * var viewport = scene.viewport;
 * viewport.autoBoundary = false;
 *
 * scene.on("rendering", function (e) {
 *      switch (e.pass) {
 *          case 0:
 *              viewport.boundary = [0, 0, 200, 200]; // xmin, ymin, width, height
 *              break;
 *
 *          case 1:
 *              viewport.boundary = [200, 0, 200, 200];
 *              break;
 *      }
 * });
 *
 * // We can also intercept the Scene after each render,
 * // (though we're not using this for anything here)
 * scene.on("rendered", function (e) {
 *      switch (e.pass) {
 *          case 0:
 *              break;
 *
 *          case 1:
 *              break;
 *      }
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## Gamma correction
 *
 * Within its shaders, xeokit performs shading calculations in linear space.
 *
 * By default, the Scene expects color textures (eg. {@link PhongMaterial#diffuseMap},
 * {@link MetallicMaterial#baseColorMap} and {@link SpecularMaterial#diffuseMap}) to
 * be in pre-multipled gamma space, so will convert those to linear space before they are used in shaders. Other textures are
 * always expected to be in linear space.
 *
 * By default, the Scene will also gamma-correct its rendered output.
 *
 * You can configure the Scene to expect all those color textures to be linear space, so that it does not gamma-correct them:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * scene.gammaInput = false;
 * ````
 *
 * You would still need to gamma-correct the output, though, if it's going straight to the canvas, so normally we would
 * leave that enabled:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * scene.gammaOutput = true;
 * ````
 *
 * See {@link Texture} for more information on texture encoding and gamma.
