/**
 * @desc Base class for all xeokit components.
 *
 * ## Component IDs
 *
 * Every Component has an ID that's unique within the parent {@link Scene}. xeokit generates
 * the IDs automatically by default, however you can also specify them yourself. In the example below, we're creating a
 * scene comprised of {@link Scene}, {@link Material}, {@link ReadableGeometry} and
 * {@link Mesh} components, while letting xeokit generate its own ID for
 * the {@link ReadableGeometry}:
 *
 *````JavaScript
 * import {Viewer, Mesh, buildTorusGeometry, ReadableGeometry, PhongMaterial, Texture, Fresnel} from "xeokit-sdk.es.js";
 *
 * const viewer = new Viewer({
 *        canvasId: "myCanvas"
 *    });
 *
 * viewer.scene.camera.eye = [0, 0, 5];
 * viewer.scene.camera.look = [0, 0, 0];
 * viewer.scene.camera.up = [0, 1, 0];
 *
 * new Mesh(viewer.scene, {
 *      geometry: new ReadableGeometry(viewer.scene, buildTorusGeometry({
 *          center: [0, 0, 0],
 *          radius: 1.5,
 *          tube: 0.5,
 *          radialSegments: 32,
 *          tubeSegments: 24,
 *          arc: Math.PI * 2.0
 *      }),
 *      material: new PhongMaterial(viewer.scene, {
 *          id: "myMaterial",
 *          ambient: [0.9, 0.3, 0.9],
 *          shininess: 30,
 *          diffuseMap: new Texture(viewer.scene, {
 *              src: "textures/diffuse/uvGrid2.jpg"
 *          }),
 *          specularFresnel: new Fresnel(viewer.scene, {
 *              leftColor: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
 *              rightColor: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
 *              power: 4
 *          })
 *     })
 * });
 *````
 *
 * We can then find those components like this:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * // Find the Material
 * var material = viewer.scene.components["myMaterial"];
 *
 * // Find all PhongMaterials in the Scene
 * var phongMaterials = viewer.scene.types["PhongMaterial"];
 *
 * // Find our Material within the PhongMaterials
 * var materialAgain = phongMaterials["myMaterial"];
 * ````
 *
 * ## Restriction on IDs
 *
 * Auto-generated IDs are of the form ````"__0"````, ````"__1"````, ````"__2"```` ... and so on.
 *
 * Scene maintains a map of these IDs, along with a counter that it increments each time it generates a new ID.
 *
 * If Scene has created the IDs listed above, and we then destroy the ````Component```` with ID ````"__1"````,
 * Scene will mark that ID as available, and will reuse it for the next default ID.
 *
 * Therefore, two restrictions your on IDs:
 *
 * * don't use IDs that begin with two underscores, and
 * * don't reuse auto-generated IDs of destroyed Components.
 *
 * ## Logging
 *
 * Components have methods to log ID-prefixed messages to the JavaScript console:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * material.log("Everything is fine, situation normal.");
 * material.warn("Wait, whats that red light?");
 * material.error("Aw, snap!");
 * ````
 *
 * The logged messages will look like this in the console:
 *
 * ````text
 * [LOG]   myMaterial: Everything is fine, situation normal.
 * [WARN]  myMaterial: Wait, whats that red light..
 * [ERROR] myMaterial: Aw, snap!
 * ````
 *
 * ## Destruction
 *
 * Get notification of destruction of Components:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * material.once("destroyed", function() {
 *     this.log("Component was destroyed: " + this.id);
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * Or get notification of destruction of any Component within its {@link Scene}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * scene.on("componentDestroyed", function(component) {
 *     this.log("Component was destroyed: " + component.id);
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * Then destroy a component like this:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * material.destroy();
 * ````
