/**
 * @desc Tracks the World, View and Canvas coordinates, and visibility, of a position within a {@link Scene}.
 *
 * ## Position
 *
 * A Marker holds its position in the World, View and Canvas coordinate systems in three properties:
 *
 * * {@link Marker#worldPos} holds the Marker's 3D World-space coordinates. This property can be dynamically updated. The Marker will fire a "worldPos" event whenever this property changes.
 * * {@link Marker#viewPos} holds the Marker's 3D View-space coordinates. This property is read-only, and is automatically updated from {@link Marker#worldPos} and the current {@link Camera} position. The Marker will fire a "viewPos" event whenever this property changes.
 * * {@link Marker#canvasPos} holds the Marker's 2D Canvas-space coordinates. This property is read-only, and is automatically updated from {@link Marker#canvasPos} and the current {@link Camera} position and projection. The Marker will fire a "canvasPos" event whenever this property changes.
 *
 * ## Visibility
 *
 * {@link Marker#visible} indicates if the Marker is currently visible. The Marker will fire a "visible" event whenever {@link Marker#visible} changes.
 *
 * This property will be ````false```` when:
 *
 * * {@link Marker#entity} is set to an {@link Entity}, and {@link Entity#visible} is ````false````,
 * * {@link Marker#occludable} is ````true```` and the Marker is occluded by some {@link Entity} in the 3D view, or
 * * {@link Marker#canvasPos} is outside the boundary of the {@link Canvas}.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * In the example below, we'll create a Marker that's associated with a {@link Mesh} (which a type of {@link Entity}).
 *
 * We'll configure our Marker to
 * become invisible whenever it's occluded by any Entities in the canvas.
 *
 * We'll also demonstrate how to query the Marker's visibility status and position (in the World, View and
 * Canvas coordinate systems), and how to subscribe to change events on those properties.
 *

 * // when worldPos or viewPos was updated, or Camera's projection was updated
 * myMarker.on("canvasPos", function(canvasPos) {

 * });
 *
 * // Listen for change of Marker visibility. The Marker becomes invisible when it falls outside the canvas,
 * // has an Entity that is also invisible, or when an Entity occludes the Marker's position in the 3D view.
 * myMarker.on("visible", function(visible) { // Marker visibility has changed
