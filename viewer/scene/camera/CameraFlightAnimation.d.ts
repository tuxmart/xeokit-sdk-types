/**
 * @desc Jumps or flies the {@link Scene}'s {@link Camera} to a given target.
 *
 * * Located at {@link Viewer#cameraFlight}
 * * Can fly or jump to its target.
 * * While flying, can be stopped, or redirected to a different target.
 * * Can also smoothly transition between ortho and perspective projections.
 *
 *
 * A CameraFlightAnimation's target can be:
 *
 * * specific ````eye````, ````look```` and ````up```` positions,
 * * an axis-aligned World-space bounding box (AABB), or
 * * an instance or ID of any {@link Component} subtype that provides a World-space AABB.
 *
 * A target can also contain a ````projection```` type to transition into. For example, if your {@link Camera#projection} is
 * currently ````"perspective"```` and you supply {@link CameraFlightAnimation#flyTo} with a ````projection```` property
 * equal to "ortho", then CameraFlightAnimation will smoothly transition the Camera into an orthographic projection.
 *
 * Configure {@link CameraFlightAnimation#fit} and {@link CameraFlightAnimation#fitFOV} to make it stop at the point
 * where the target occupies a certain amount of the field-of-view.
 *
 * ## Flying to an Entity
 *
 * Flying to an {@link Entity}:
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * var entity = new Mesh(viewer.scene);
 *
 * // Fly to the Entity's World-space AABB
 * viewer.cameraFlight.flyTo(entity);
 * ````
 * ## Flying to a Position
 *
 * Flying the CameraFlightAnimation from the previous example to specified eye, look and up positions:
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * viewer.cameraFlight.flyTo({
 *    eye: [-5,-5,-5],
 *    look: [0,0,0]
 *    up: [0,1,0],
 *    duration: 1 // Default, seconds
 * },() => {
 *      // Done
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## Flying to an AABB
 *
 * Flying the CameraFlightAnimation from the previous two examples explicitly to the {@link Boundary3D"}}Boundary3D's{{/crossLink}}
 * axis-aligned bounding box:
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * viewer.cameraFlight.flyTo(entity.aabb);
 * ````
 *
 * ## Transitioning Between Projections
 *
 * CameraFlightAnimation also allows us to smoothly transition between Camera projections. We can do that by itself, or
 * in addition to flying the Camera to a target.
 *
 * Let's transition the Camera to orthographic projection:
 *
 * [[Run example](http://xeokit.github.io/xeokit-sdk/examples/#camera_CameraFlightAnimation_projection)]
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * viewer.cameraFlight.flyTo({ projection: "ortho", () => {
 *      // Done
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * Now let's transition the Camera back to perspective projection:
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * viewer.cameraFlight.flyTo({ projection: "perspective"}, () => {
 *      // Done
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * Fly Camera to a position, while transitioning to orthographic projection:
 *
 * ````Javascript
 * viewer.cameraFlight.flyTo({
 *     eye: [-100,20,2],
 *     look: [0,0,-40],
 *     up: [0,1,0],
 *     projection: "ortho", () => {
 *        // Done
 * });
 * ````
