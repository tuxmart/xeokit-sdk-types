/**
 * @desc Manages viewing and projection transforms for its {@link Scene}.
 *
 * * One Camera per {@link Scene}
 * * Scene is located at {@link Viewer#scene} and Camera is located at {@link Scene#camera}
 * * Controls viewing and projection transforms
 * * Has methods to pan, zoom and orbit (or first-person rotation)
 * * Dynamically configurable World-space axis
 * * Has {@link Perspective}, {@link Ortho} and {@link Frustum} and {@link CustomProjection}, which you can dynamically switch it between
 * * Switchable gimbal lock
 * * Can be "flown" to look at targets using a {@link CameraFlightAnimation}
 * * Can be animated along a path using a {@link CameraPathAnimation}
 *
 * ## Getting the Camera
 *
 * There is exactly one Camera per {@link Scene}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * import {Viewer} from "xeokit-sdk.es.js";
 *
 * var camera = viewer.scene.camera;
 *
 * ````
 *
 * ## Setting the Camera Position
 *
 * Get and set the Camera's absolute position via {@link Camera#eye}, {@link Camera#look} and {@link Camera#up}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.eye = [-10,0,0];
 * camera.look = [-10,0,0];
 * camera.up = [0,1,0];
 * ````
 *
 * ## Camera View and Projection Matrices
 *
 * The Camera's view matrix transforms coordinates from World-space to View-space.
 *
 * Getting the view matrix:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var viewMatrix = camera.viewMatrix;
 * var viewNormalMatrix = camera.normalMatrix;
 * ````
 *
 * The Camera's view normal matrix transforms normal vectors from World-space to View-space.
 *
 * Getting the view normal matrix:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var viewNormalMatrix = camera.normalMatrix;
 * ````
 *
 * The Camera fires a ````"viewMatrix"```` event whenever the {@link Camera#viewMatrix} and {@link Camera#viewNormalMatrix} updates.
 *
 * Listen for view matrix updates:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.on("viewMatrix", function(matrix) { ... });
 * ````
 *
 * ## Rotating the Camera
 *
 * Orbiting the {@link Camera#look} position:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.orbitYaw(20.0);
 * camera.orbitPitch(10.0);
 * ````
 *
 * First-person rotation, rotates {@link Camera#look} and {@link Camera#up} about {@link Camera#eye}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.yaw(5.0);
 * camera.pitch(-10.0);
 * ````
 *
 * ## Panning the Camera
 *
 * Panning along the Camera's local axis (ie. left/right, up/down, forward/backward):
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.pan([-20, 0, 10]);
 * ````
 *
 * ## Zooming the Camera
 *
 * Zoom to vary distance between {@link Camera#eye} and {@link Camera#look}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.zoom(-5); // Move five units closer
 * ````
 *
 * Get the current distance between {@link Camera#eye} and {@link Camera#look}:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var distance = camera.eyeLookDist;
 * ````
 *
 * ## Projection
 *
 * The Camera has a Component to manage each projection type, which are: {@link Perspective}, {@link Ortho}
 * and {@link Frustum} and {@link CustomProjection}.
 *
 * You can configure those components at any time, regardless of which is currently active:
 *
 * The Camera has a {@link Perspective} to manage perspective
 * ````javascript
 *
 * // Set some properties on Perspective
 * camera.perspective.near = 0.4;
 * camera.perspective.fov = 45;
 *
 * // Set some properties on Ortho
 * camera.ortho.near = 0.8;
 * camera.ortho.far = 1000;
 *
 * // Set some properties on Frustum
 * camera.frustum.left = -1.0;
 * camera.frustum.right = 1.0;
 * camera.frustum.far = 1000.0;
 *
 * // Set the matrix property on CustomProjection
 * camera.customProjection.matrix = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1];
 *
 * // Switch between the projection types
 * camera.projection = "perspective"; // Switch to perspective
 * camera.projection = "frustum"; // Switch to frustum
 * camera.projection = "ortho"; // Switch to ortho
 * camera.projection = "customProjection"; // Switch to custom
 * ````
 *
 * Camera provides the projection matrix for the currently active projection in {@link Camera#projMatrix}.
 *
 * Get the projection matrix:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var projMatrix = camera.projMatrix;
 * ````
 *
 * Listen for projection matrix updates:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.on("projMatrix", function(matrix) { ... });
 * ````
 *
 * ## Configuring World up direction
 *
 * We can dynamically configure the directions of the World-space coordinate system.
 *
 * Setting the +Y axis as World "up", +X as right and -Z as forwards (convention in some modeling software):
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.worldAxis = [
 *     1, 0, 0,    // Right
 *     0, 1, 0,    // Up
 *     0, 0,-1     // Forward
 * ];
 * ````
 *
 * Setting the +Z axis as World "up", +X as right and -Y as "up" (convention in most CAD and BIM viewers):
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.worldAxis = [
 *     1, 0, 0, // Right
 *     0, 0, 1, // Up
 *     0,-1, 0  // Forward
 * ];
 * ````
 *
 * The Camera has read-only convenience properties that provide each axis individually:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * var worldRight = camera.worldRight;
 * var worldForward = camera.worldForward;
 * var worldUp = camera.worldUp;
 * ````
 *
 * ### Gimbal locking
 *
 * By default, the Camera locks yaw rotation to pivot about the World-space "up" axis. We can dynamically lock and unlock that at any time:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * camera.gimbalLock = false; // Yaw rotation now happens about Camera's local Y-axis
 * camera.gimbalLock = true; // Yaw rotation now happens about World's "up" axis
 * ````
 *
 * See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock</a>
