/**
 * @desc Displays a progress animation at the center of its {@link Canvas} while things are loading or otherwise busy.
 *
 *
 * * Located at {@link Canvas#spinner}.
 * * Automatically shown while things are loading, however may also be shown by application code wanting to indicate busyness.
 * * {@link Spinner#processes} holds the count of active processes. As a process starts, it increments {@link Spinner#processes}, then decrements it on completion or failure.
 * * A Spinner is only visible while {@link Spinner#processes} is greater than zero.

 * spinner.processes++;
 *
 * // Increment the count again, by some other process; spinner already visible, now requires two decrements
 * // before it becomes invisible again
 * spinner.processes++;
 *
 * // Decrement the count; count still greater than zero, so spinner remains visible
 * spinner.process--;
