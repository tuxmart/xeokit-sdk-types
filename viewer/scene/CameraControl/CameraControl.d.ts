 * # Overview
 *
 * * Each {@link Viewer} has a ````CameraControl````, located at {@link Viewer#cameraControl}.
 * * {@link CameraControl#navMode} selects the navigation mode:
 *      * ````"orbit"```` rotates the {@link Camera} position about the target.
 *      * ````"firstPerson"```` rotates the World about the Camera position.
 *      * ````"planView"```` never rotates, but still allows to pan and dolly, typically for an axis-aligned view.
 * * {@link CameraControl#followPointer} makes the Camera follow the mouse or touch pointer.
 * * {@link CameraControl#constrainVertical} locks the Camera to its current height when in first-person mode.
 * * ````CameraControl```` fires pick events when we hover, click or tap on an {@link Entity}.

 *
 * # Orbit Mode
 *
 * In orbit mode, ````CameraControl```` orbits the {@link Camera} about the target.
 *
 * To enable orbit mode:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * const cameraControl = myViewer.cameraControl;
 * cameraControl.navMode = "orbit";
 * ````
 *
 * Then orbit by:
 *
 * * left-dragging the mouse,
 * * tap-dragging the touch pad, and
 * * pressing arrow keys, or ````Q```` and ````E```` on a QWERTY keyboard, or ````A```` and ````E```` on an AZERTY keyboard.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Dolly forwards and backwards by:
 *
 * * spinning the mouse wheel,
 * * pinching on the touch pad, and
 * * pressing the ````+```` and ````-```` keys, or ````W```` and ````S```` on a QWERTY keyboard, or ````Z```` and ````S```` for AZERTY.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Pan horizontally and vertically by:
 *
 * * right-dragging the mouse,
 * * left-dragging the mouse with the SHIFT key down,
 * * tap-dragging the touch pad with SHIFT down,
 * * pressing the ````A````, ````D````, ````Z```` and ````X```` keys on a QWERTY keyboard, and
 * * pressing the ````Q````, ````D````, ````W```` and ````X```` keys on an AZERTY keyboard,
 * <br><br>
 *
 * ## Following the Pointer in Orbit Mode
 *
 * When {@link CameraControl#followPointer} is ````true````in orbiting mode, the mouse or touch pointer will dynamically
 * indicate the target that the {@link Camera} will orbit, as well as dolly to and from.
 *
 * Lets ensure that we're in orbit mode, then enable the {@link Camera} to follow the pointer:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.navMode = "orbit";
 * cameraControl.followPointer = true;
 * ````
 *
 * ## Smart Pivoting
 *
 * TODO
 *
 * ## Showing the Pivot Position
 *
 * We can configure {@link CameraControl#pivotElement} with an HTML element to indicate the current
 * pivot position. The indicator will appear momentarily each time we move the {@link Camera} while in orbit mode with
 * {@link CameraControl#followPointer} set ````true````.
 *
 * First we'll define some CSS to style our pivot indicator as a black dot with a white border:
 *
 * ````css
 * .camera-pivot-marker {
 *      color: #ffffff;
 *      position: absolute;
 *      width: 25px;
 *      height: 25px;
 *      border-radius: 15px;
 *      border: 2px solid #ebebeb;
 *      background: black;
 *      visibility: hidden;
 *      box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 1px #000000;
 *      z-index: 10000;
 *      pointer-events: none;
 * }
 * ````
 *
 * Then we'll attach our pivot indicator's HTML element to the ````CameraControl````:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * const pivotElement = document.createRange().createContextualFragment("<div class='camera-pivot-marker'></div>").firstChild;
 *
 * document.body.appendChild(pivotElement);
 *
 * cameraControl.pivotElement = pivotElement;
 * ````
 *
 * ## Axis-Aligned Views in Orbit Mode
 *
 * In orbit mode, we can use keys 1-6 to position the {@link Camera} to look at the center of the {@link Scene} from along each of the
 * six World-space axis. Pressing one of these keys will fly the {@link Camera} to the corresponding axis-aligned view.
 *
 * ## View-Fitting Entitys in Orbit Mode
 *
 * When {@link CameraControl#doublePickFlyTo} is ````true````, we can left-double-click or
 * double-tap (ie. "double-pick") an {@link Entity} to fit it to view. This will cause the {@link Camera}
 * to fly to that Entity. Our target then becomes the center of that Entity. If we are currently pivoting,
 * then our pivot position is then also set to the Entity center.
 *
 * Disable that behaviour by setting {@link CameraControl#doublePickFlyTo} ````false````.
 *
 * # First-Person Mode
 *
 * In first-person mode, ````CameraControl```` rotates the World about the {@link Camera} position.
 *
 * To enable first-person mode:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.navMode = "firstPerson";
 * ````
 *
 * Then rotate by:
 *
 * * left-dragging the mouse,
 * * tap-dragging the touch pad,
 * * pressing arrow keys, or ````Q```` and ````E```` on a QWERTY keyboard, or ````A```` and ````E```` on an AZERTY keyboard.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Dolly forwards and backwards by:
 *
 * * spinning the mouse wheel,
 * * pinching on the touch pad, and
 * * pressing the ````+```` and ````-```` keys, or ````W```` and ````S```` on a QWERTY keyboard, or ````Z```` and ````S```` for AZERTY.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Pan left, right, up and down by:
 *
 * * left-dragging or right-dragging the mouse, and
 * * tap-dragging the touch pad with SHIFT down.
 *
 * Pan forwards, backwards, left, right, up and down by pressing the ````WSADZX```` keys on a QWERTY keyboard,
 * or ````WSQDWX```` keys on an AZERTY keyboard.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * ## Following the Pointer in First-Person Mode
 *
 * When {@link CameraControl#followPointer} is ````true```` in first-person mode, the mouse or touch pointer will dynamically
 * indicate the target to which the {@link Camera} will dolly to and from. In first-person mode, however, the World will always rotate
 * about the {@link Camera} position.
 *
 * Lets ensure that we're in first-person mode, then enable the {@link Camera} to follow the pointer:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.navMode = "firstPerson";
 * cameraControl.followPointer = true;
 * ````
 *
 * When the pointer is over empty space, the target will remain the last object that the pointer was over.
 *
 * ## Constraining Vertical Position in First-Person Mode
 *
 * In first-person mode, we can lock the {@link Camera} to its current position on the vertical World axis, which is useful for walk-through navigation:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.constrainVertical = true;
 * ````
 *
 * ## Axis-Aligned Views in First-Person Mode
 *
 * In first-person mode we can use keys 1-6 to position the {@link Camera} to look at the center of
 * the {@link Scene} from along each of the six World-space axis. Pressing one of these keys will fly the {@link Camera} to the
 * corresponding axis-aligned view.
 *
 * ## View-Fitting Entitys in First-Person Mode
 *
 * As in orbit mode, when in first-person mode and {@link CameraControl#doublePickFlyTo} is ````true````, we can double-click
 * or double-tap an {@link Entity} (ie. "double-picking") to fit it in view. This will cause the {@link Camera} to fly to
 * that Entity. Our target then becomes the center of that Entity.
 *
 * Disable that behaviour by setting {@link CameraControl#doublePickFlyTo} ````false````.
 *
 * # Plan-View Mode
 *
 * In plan-view mode, ````CameraControl```` pans and rotates the {@link Camera}, without rotating it.
 *
 * To enable plan-view mode:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.navMode = "planView";
 * ````
 *
 * Dolly forwards and backwards by:
 *
 * * spinning the mouse wheel,
 * * pinching on the touch pad, and
 * * pressing the ````+```` and ````-```` keys.
 *
 * <br>
 * Pan left, right, up and down by:
 *
 * * left-dragging or right-dragging the mouse, and
 * * tap-dragging the touch pad with SHIFT down.
 *
 * Pan forwards, backwards, left, right, up and down by pressing the ````WSADZX```` keys on a QWERTY keyboard,
 * or ````WSQDWX```` keys on an AZERTY keyboard.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * ## Following the Pointer in Plan-View Mode
 *
 * When {@link CameraControl#followPointer} is ````true```` in plan-view mode, the mouse or touch pointer will dynamically
 * indicate the target to which the {@link Camera} will dolly to and from.  In plan-view mode, however, the {@link Camera} cannot rotate.
 *
 * Lets ensure that we're in plan-view mode, then enable the {@link Camera} to follow the pointer:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.navMode = "planView";
 * cameraControl.followPointer = true; // Default
 * ````
 *
 * When the pointer is over empty space, the target will remain the last object that the pointer was over.
 *
 * ## Axis-Aligned Views in Plan-View Mode
 *
 * As in orbit and first-person modes, in plan-view mode we can use keys 1-6 to position the {@link Camera} to look at the center of
 * the {@link Scene} from along each of the six World-space axis. Pressing one of these keys will fly the {@link Camera} to the
 * corresponding axis-aligned view.
 *
 * # CameraControl Events
 *
 * ````CameraControl```` fires events as we interact with {@link Entity}s using mouse or touch input.
 *
 * The following examples demonstrate how to subscribe to those events.
 *
 * The first example shows how to save a handle to a subscription, which we can later use to unsubscribe.
 *
 * ## "hover"
 *
 * Event fired when the pointer moves while hovering over an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * const onHover = cameraControl.on("hover", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity; // Entity
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos; // 2D canvas position
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * To unsubscribe from the event:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.off(onHover);
 * ````
 *
 * ## "hoverOff"
 *
 * Event fired when the pointer moves while hovering over empty space.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("hoverOff", (e) => {
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "hoverEnter"
 *
 * Event fired when the pointer moves onto an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("hoverEnter", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity;
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "hoverOut"
 *
 * Event fired when the pointer moves off an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("hoverOut", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity;
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "picked"
 *
 * Event fired when we left-click or tap on an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("picked", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity;
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "pickedSurface"
 *
 * Event fired when we left-click or tap on the surface of an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("picked", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity;
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 *      const worldPos = e.worldPos; // 3D World-space position
 *      const viewPos = e.viewPos; // 3D View-space position
 *      const worldNormal = e.worldNormal; // 3D World-space normal vector
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "pickedNothing"
 *
 * Event fired when we left-click or tap on empty space.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("pickedNothing", (e) => {
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "doublePicked"
 *
 * Event fired wwhen we left-double-click or double-tap on an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("doublePicked", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity;
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "doublePickedSurface"
 *
 * Event fired when we left-double-click or double-tap on the surface of an Entity.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("doublePickedSurface", (e) => {
 *      const entity = e.entity;
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 *      const worldPos = e.worldPos;
 *      const viewPos = e.viewPos;
 *      const worldNormal = e.worldNormal;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "doublePickedNothing"
 *
 * Event fired when we left-double-click or double-tap on empty space.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("doublePickedNothing", (e) => {
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## "rightClick"
 *
 * Event fired when we right-click on the canvas.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.on("rightClick", (e) => {
 *      const event = e.event; // Mouse event
 *      const canvasPos = e.canvasPos;
 * });
 * ````
 *
 * ## Custom Keyboard Mappings
 *
 * We can customize````CameraControl```` key bindings as shown below.
 *
 * In this example, we'll just set the default bindings for a QWERTY keyboard.
 *
 * ````javascript
 * const input = myViewer.scene.input;
 *
 * cameraControl.navMode = "orbit";
 * cameraControl.followPointer = true;
 *
 * const keyMap = {};
 *
 * keyMap[cameraControl.PAN_LEFT] = [input.KEY_A];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.PAN_RIGHT] = [input.KEY_D];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.PAN_UP] = [input.KEY_Z];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.PAN_DOWN] = [input.KEY_X];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.DOLLY_FORWARDS] = [input.KEY_W, input.KEY_ADD];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.DOLLY_BACKWARDS] = [input.KEY_S, input.KEY_SUBTRACT];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.ROTATE_X_POS] = [input.KEY_DOWN_ARROW];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.ROTATE_X_NEG] = [input.KEY_UP_ARROW];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.ROTATE_Y_POS] = [input.KEY_LEFT_ARROW];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.ROTATE_Y_NEG] = [input.KEY_RIGHT_ARROW];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.AXIS_VIEW_RIGHT] = [input.KEY_NUM_1];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.AXIS_VIEW_BACK] = [input.KEY_NUM_2];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.AXIS_VIEW_LEFT] = [input.KEY_NUM_3];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.AXIS_VIEW_FRONT] = [input.KEY_NUM_4];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.AXIS_VIEW_TOP] = [input.KEY_NUM_5];
 * keyMap[cameraControl.AXIS_VIEW_BOTTOM] = [input.KEY_NUM_6];
 *
 * cameraControl.keyMap = keyMap;
 * ````
 *
 * We can also just configure default bindings for a specified keyboard layout, like this:
 *
 * ````javascript
 * cameraControl.keyMap = "qwerty";
 * ````
 *
 * Then, ````CameraControl```` will internally set {@link CameraControl#keyMap} to the default key map for the QWERTY
 * layout (which is the same set of mappings we set in the previous example). In other words, if we subsequently
 * read {@link CameraControl#keyMap}, it will now be a key map, instead of the "qwerty" string value we set it to.
 *
 * Supported layouts are, so far:
 *
 * * ````"qwerty"````
 * * ````"azerty"````
